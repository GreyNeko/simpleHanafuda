# simpleHanafuda
A simple card matching game

This game is based upon a varient of the classicical hanafuda card game, called Hanafuda Hawaiian Style or Hawaiian style koi-koi,
the idea found from (http://hanafudahawaii.com/). Although this may not fully represent the complete card game, it is however 
a stylized card matching game. The images that represent the deck of cards are sourced from Wikimedia commons image repository, 
or found from the Hanafuda card game wikipedia entry. The background images are of my creation.
